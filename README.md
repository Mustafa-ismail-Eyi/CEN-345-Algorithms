# CEN-345-Algorithms
 Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) vs. General Regression Neural Network (GRNN)

1) Introduce the working principles of both ML algorithms
2) Discuss the major similarities and differences between the two ML algorithms
3) Demonstrate an application of both algorithms on a sample dataset (you can choice any ML training software, e.g. MATLAB, Weka etc.)
